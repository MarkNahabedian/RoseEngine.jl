In this package, angles are in units of fractions of a full circle, arther than in degrees or radians.\n\nradius is the radius at zero amplitude.\n\namplitude is the extent above and below radius of the range of the \"cutter\".  The range of the Rotor funnction will be from radius - amplitude to radius + amplitude.\n\nwave_function is a function describing one cycle of the wave.  Its domain goes from 0 to 1 and its range goes from -1 to 1.  See [triangle_wave(@ref) as an example.\n\nwaves_per_rotation is the number of full oscillations of wave_function per one turn of the Rotor.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#RoseEngine.full_cycle_count-Tuple{Rotor}","page":"Home","title":"RoseEngine.full_cycle_count","text":"full_cycle_count(::Rotor)::Int\n\nReturns the number of cycles that the Rotor should rotate such that its wave_function returns to its starting point (same angle and radius).
